	abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico shrimp otter trawl fishery operates throughout the U.S. Waters of the Gulf of Mexico including coastal and shelf waters and bays, sounds and estuaries. The Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shrimp fisheries are defined as a Category II fishery under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Gulf of Mexico otter trawl fishery has the potential to impact Gulf of Mexico common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and Atlantic spotted dolphin continental shelf stock, three bottlenose dolphin coastal stocks, and 31 bottlenose dolphin bay, sound and estuary (BSE) stocks. Total annual bycatch mortalities of marine mammals in the shrimp otter trawl fishery from 2012 - 2014 are estimated using data from NMFS's shrimp fishery observer program and stratified shrimp fishery effort models. By catch rates are calculated under two stratification scenarios and under two species identification assumptions. Annual mortality estimates for 2012, 2013, and 2014 are calculated using the ratio estimator with stratified annual fishery effort data for 2012 to 2014 and aggregate bycatch rates for 1997 to 2014. For each of the three years, 5-year unweighted mean mortality estimates are calculated for Gulf of Mexico dolphin stocks. BSE mortality estimates are aggregated at the state level.},

	title = {Estimation of {Pelagic} {Shark} {Bycatch} and {Associated} {Mortality} in {Canadian} {Atlantic} {Fisheries}},
	abstract = {The estimation of pelagic shark bycatch, discards and discard mortality was an objective of both the Workplan to Address Incidental Catch in Canadian Large Pelagic Fisheries and the associated Regional Advisory Process meeting (held 11-12 July, 2011). In addition to quantifying all sources of bycatch for porbeagle (Lamna nasus), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), and blue shark (Prionace glauca), we used documented or inferred capture and post-release mortality rates to estimate total discard mortality, and tested the key assumptions underlying the use of observer data to estimate fishery-scale discards. Annual estimates of shark discards by fishery indicated that the swordfish/tuna fishery accounted for 58\% of 57 mt of porbeagle discards, 70\% of 23 mt of mako discards, and 99\% of 1414 mt of blue shark discards in 2010. Aggregated across all fisheries, an estimated 29 mt of non-retained porbeagle died from fishing-related causes in 2010, which is equivalent to 35\% of reported landings. A total of 11 mt of non-retained mako did not survive fishing in 2010, which is equivalent to 29\% of the reported landings. Discarded blue sharks which did not survive fishing totalled 495 mt in 2010, which far exceeded landings. Based on tests of accuracy of the bycatch estimation method, the bycatch and discard amounts for these shark species are expected to be reasonably close to reality. Porbeagle bycatch is largely limited to Emerald Basin and the edge of the Scotian Shelf, but bycatches of mako and blue shark are more broadly representative of the distribution of the pelagic longline fishery in the northwest Atlantic.},

	abstract = {Conservation of ecologically related species and understanding the discard composition of fisheries are major concerns for marine ecosystem conservation. However, high sea longline fisheries data are insufficient because of difficulties in deploying observers for data collection. Observer data collected from 77 trips on Taiwanese large-scale longline fishing vessels in the Indian Ocean from June 2004 to March 2008 were used to estimate the scale of the bycatch. At least 40 species were recorded. Albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, and southern bluefin tuna were the major species recorded and comprised over 73.30\% of the total retained catch. Major bycatch species were swordfish, blue shark, sailfish, pomfret, and escolar. The average discard rate was 14.09\%, ranging from 3.20\% for the yellowfin tuna fleet to 18.09\% for the bigeye tuna fleet. In total, 0.80\% of the catch of the albacore, 4.74\% of the bigeye, and 2.32\% of the yellowfin tuna were discarded. There were significant differences among seasons and areas for the discard rates of the bigeye and yellowfin tuna. The discard rates of the bigeye and southern bluefin tuna were positively correlated to the catch per unit effort. The depredation percentage of tuna by cetaceans was from 0.7\% to 12.3\% of total discards for the different fleets. The high discard and cetacean depredation rates showed that major possible reasons for discards are depredation by cetaceans, economic factors, and quota limitations. Regarding other species, 61 seabirds and 84 sea turtles were a part of the bycatch. The major species were Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross in the southern Indian Ocean and Olive Ridley turtles in tropical areas. The estimated annual incidental catch numbers were 715 to 311 seabirds and 1856 to 1127 sea turtles from 2004 to 2007. For conservation, this discard information could be used to assess tuna stocks. Mitigation measures, including the live release of small-sized fish, and the use of bird-scaring lines and circle hooks, are required to minimize the bycatch.},

	abstract = {Observers aboard commercial trawlers collected data on the total catch composition of 614 and 479 hauls made by vessels operating off the south and west coasts of South Africa, respectively. On the south coast, four fishing areas were identified on the basis of target species and fishing depth. On the west coast, hauls were separated into those targeting hake Merluccius spp. in four depth ranges (0–300, 301–400, 401–500, and {\textgreater}500m) and those targeting monkfish Lophius vomerinus. For each area, the catch composition was calculated and the species assemblages were investigated using cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling. Finally, for each coast, the weight of fish discarded annually was estimated. On the south coast, although hake dominated, between 21\% and 47\% of the catch was not hake, depending on the fishing area. In comparison, hake dominated west coast catches, the proportion of hake increasing with depth. For each fishery investigated, approximately 90\% of the catch was processed and landed. However, estimates of annual discards indicate that the south and west coast fisheries may annually discard 9000 or 10,000t and 17,000 or 25,000t, of undersized and unutilizable fish and offal, respectively, depending on the estimation method used. When developing strategies to limit or enhance utilization of bycatch, cognisance should be taken of the differences in catch composition between the south and west coasts and of the importance of bycatch revenue to south coast fishing companies.},

	abstract = {Government fisheries observers made detailed records of the catch weights of all species caught on 545 trawls between October 1997 and August 2000 in the South Tasman Rise orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) fishery. Bycatch ratios, the ratio of bycatch weight to tow duration, were derived from these data and used to make estimates of total annual bycatch for several species groups. Bycatch ratios based on tow duration were chosen over ratios based on orange roughy catch weights after comparing the coefficients of variation (c.v.) of sets of trial data. Bycatch ratios and total bycatch were estimated for three species of oreos (Oreosomatidae), corals and all other bycatch species combined, for the fishing years from 1997–1998 to 2000–2001. Total oreo bycatch dropped from about 7400 t to less than 350 t during this time. These estimates agreed well with recorded oreo landings data for three of the four years. There was a considerable bycatch of corals, with both the bycatch ratio and the total bycatch reducing during the period examined, the latter from about 1750 t to 100 t per year. The coral bycatch comprised a large number of species, but was dominated by the reef-forming stony coral Solenosmilia variabilis. Annual bycatch of all other species combined, mainly rattails (Macrouridae) and dogfishes (Squalidae), was low (13–120 t). Bycatch of this group dropped sharply in each year as the result of a combination of decreasing bycatch ratio and decreasing fishing effort.},

	abstract = {A considerable amount of the existing knowledge of discards in the Mediterranean Sea is presented. Discarding highly varies along the basin both geographically and among the different ﬁshing gears with bottom trawls being responsible for the bulk of discards, since they are characterized by high discards ratios. Midwater trawls, purse-seines, and small-scale ﬁsheries, despite their less proportion of discards per se, produce overall high discards quantities, since they are responsible for the majority of the landings. Based on the collected information, a rough Mediterranean-wide estimate of discards around 230 000 t or 18.6\% (13.3 –26.8\%) of the catch is produced. Discarding in the Mediterranean is regulated by market demands rather than by legal constraints, and marketable bycatch may constitute an important supplemental source of income. A pattern in resource use related to socio-cultural characteristics is apparent, with welfare communities discarding more in terms of percentages. Natural conditions (e.g. environmental gradients) and ﬁshers’ strategies also substantially affect discarding. Mitigation tools mainly comprise selectivity improvement and spatio-temporal closures. Despite the progress in studying discards, needs are evident to expand monitoring schemes, apply analytical techniques, and establish objectives of the discards issue under the framework of ecosystem approach to ﬁsheries.},

	abstract = {In this study, results from an observer programme on a drift net ﬁshery in the eastern North Atlantic are presented. Observers recorded all ﬁsh, marine mammals, seabirds and turtles caught and discarded and coverage ranged from 47.8\% of the ﬂeet (n = 7 vessels) in 1996, to 2.2\% (n = 21 vessels) in 1998. A minimum of seven ﬁsh species were caught and landed during the ﬁshing period; albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) comprised approximately 99\% of the total landings (by number) in both years. Eleven ﬁsh species were discarded, of which blue shark (Prionace glauca) was the most frequently recorded representing 68\% of all ﬁsh discarded by number. At least four species of seabird (Northern Gannet Morus basanus, Northern Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, Manx shearwater Pufﬁnus pufﬁnus, Atlantic Pufﬁn Fratercula arctica) and two species of turtle, including the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), were also entangled. Eight species of Cetacea were recorded as bycatch during these ﬁshing operations, including common dolphins Delphinus delphis and striped dolphins Stenella coeruleoalba. Length–frequency distributions for both these dolphin species suggest that age segregation occurs. Using landings of albacore tuna as an indicator of effort, the extrapolated decadal scale data from Irish and other driftnet ﬂeets operating in this area suggest that during the period 1990–2000, a minimum (95\% conﬁdence intervals) of 778,452 (622,520–934,384) blue sharks were caught, with a substantial proportion discarded. An estimated 24,358 dolphins were killed during these years by these ﬂeets, of which 11,723 (7670–15,776) were common dolphins and 12,635 (10,009–15,261) were striped dolphins. Although this type of ﬁshing was effective at catching the target species, it removed a large biomass of megafauna and likely accelerated the decline of blue sharks in this area.},

Bycatch is deﬁned as nontargeted species and small or damaged target species. Bycatch species composition, main species length, sex ratio and the fate of the most common species are presented ﬁrst.
